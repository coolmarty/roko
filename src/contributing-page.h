 * How systems work and how to extend them can be found here for the image process \ref RokoImageApp
 *
 * Or here for the entire simulation \ref Sim
 *
 *to contribute to our github, first clone it onto your machine, and create a branch from dev
 *
 * from there simply add whatever features you want and push it to the github page
 *
 * create a pull request into dev, and from there one other person has to approve your changes
 *
 * once in dev it will be pulled into main with the next version update
 *
 * coding practices to follow in this project to make sure your request gets improved would be:
 *    - try to avoid using namespaces
 *    - add doxygen to all your contributions so we have well documented code
 *    - try to use 2 spaces to indent
 *    - have proper variable names (No Thingy1 Thingy2 for us my kind sir)
 *    - make sure your code compiles/all tests still pass
 *
 * If approving a pull request please make sure all of the above is true
 *
 *
