# repo-team-22
Repository for University of Minnesota's capstone. Roko's Basilisk, or "Roko" for short, was a team consisting of Emily Iverson, Dheva Subramaniam, Julia Schechter, and Matthew Altmann. 

CSCi 3081W uses a programming project to illustrate key ideas in program design/development, data structures, debugging, files, I/O, testing, and coding standards. The course was taught by Daniel Orban.

The team built upon a provided framework including a map of UMN's campus and 3D models of a drone, charging station, hospital and a robot in order to use from-scratch image recognition software, movement strategy, and battery management protocols to search the campus for the missing robot, and transport it to a pre-defined hospital location.
